TASK 1 : BASIC LINEAR REGRESSION

What I Learned:

I got how linear regression works with one feature.

Learned to fit a model and understand its predictions.

Found out R-squared shows how well the model fits the data.

Difficulties Faced:

Understanding R-squared was tricky at first.

Needed practice with data prep before training the model.

Final Thought:

It's a good foundation for understanding regression analysis.

TASK 2 : DATA VISUALISATION FOR REGRESSION

What I Learned:

How to plot data points and draw the regression line.

Visualization makes trends easier to understand.

Difficulties Faced:

Struggled with Matplotlib and Seaborn syntax initially.

Had to learn proper labeling and adding a trendline.

Final Thought:

Visuals are key to interpreting data effectively.

TASK 3 : MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

What I Learned:

How to do regression with multiple features.

Realized the importance of scaling features for better performance.

Noticed how correlated features affect predictions.

Difficulties Faced:

Handling multiple features was confusing at first.

Needed more practice interpreting coefficients.

Final Thought:

Multiple linear regression is more complex but very useful for predictive modeling
