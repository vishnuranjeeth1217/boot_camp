TASK 2 : CONSTRUCTOR USE

What I Learned:

How to create a constructor that initializes class properties.

The importance of keeping constructors clean and efficient.

Difficulties Faced:

Deciding which properties to initialize in the constructor.

Ensuring the constructor code is easy to read and maintain.

Final Thought:

Keeping constructors simple and focused is key.

Constructors play a crucial role in setting up class objects effectively.

TASK 3 : INHERITANCE

What I Learned:

How inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another.

It helps in code reuse and organizing classes logically.

Difficulties Faced:

Understanding the relationship between parent and child classes.

Figuring out when to use inheritance versus other design patterns.

Final Thought:

Inheritance is powerful for creating structured and efficient code.
