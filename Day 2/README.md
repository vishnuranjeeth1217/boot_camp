DATA SCIENCE LEARNING TASK

Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm

What I Learned: I found lots of cool ways data science is used, like predicting patient care in healthcare, spotting fraud in finance, and segmenting customers in marketing.

Difficulties Faced: It was hard to find reliable sources and stay updated with the latest trends.

Final Thought: Connecting with industry experts or communities can help a lot.

Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram

What I Learned: I now understand that AI is the broad idea of machines being smart, ML is about machines learning from data, and DL is advanced ML using neural networks.

Difficulties Faced: Making the diagram simple but still informative was tricky.

Final Thought: Getting feedback and refining the diagram can make it better.

Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research

What I Learned: Data science roles are varied: Data Scientists analyze and build models, Data Engineers create data pipelines, and Data Analysts interpret data.

Difficulties Faced: Job descriptions sometimes use terms interchangeably, which was confusing.

Final Thought: Talking to professionals and mentors can help clear things up.

Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example

What I Learned: The lifecycle includes steps like defining the problem, collecting and cleaning data, exploring data, building models, validating them, and deploying the solution.

Difficulties Faced: It was challenging to tell apart stages like feature selection (part of data cleaning) and feature engineering (enhancing data features).

Final Thought: Keeping detailed notes at each stage makes the process clearer and easier to follow.
